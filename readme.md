Thanks again for your interest in ThoughtWorks. You will find three programming problems under problems folder. We ask that you read all three descriptions thoroughly then create a program to solve **ONE** of the problems.

Introduction
------------

Once you choose one of these three problems, you have to follow the following instructions to complete your solution.

1. Mark which problem you choose by uncommenting the problem property in build.properties. e.g. if you choose trains, uncomment the first line in build.properties by removing the leading # sign.
2. Place all your production codes in src/main.
3. Place all your test codes(if any) in src/test. Currently we only accept the unit tests written in JUnit 4.9.
4. Implementing com.thoughtworks.codereview.Main class as the entry point of your solution. Make sure your main method taking 2 arguments - one for the input data file, and the other for the output file.
5. Make sure you have a successful build with the provided Ant script. The build script will run the test inputs against your solution. You can find the input files staying under cases/input/*your problem* folder, and the expected result under cases/result/*your problem*.

**Caution** : since we employed an automatic verification mechanism for the basic functionalities of your solution, if the ant build fails, your interview process will be terminated as well. **So once again, make sure you have a successful build** 

As a general rule, we allow three days from the date that you receive this letter to submit your code, but you may request more time if needed.  Since we may use your code as an interview tool, ThoughtWorks reserves the right to postpone your technical interview if your code is not received.  

ThoughtWorks would like the opportunity to offer you a challenging career with our dynamic team.  We wish you luck and look forward to receiving your response.
